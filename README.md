How to run this project : nodemon app.js
then open -> http://localhost:5000 (or any port you want)
There's some endpoint need to know :
- "/" -> root endpoint
- "/recognizing-face" -> Registering face to Model and Database
- "/recognizer-face" -> Checking if a face in image is registered in model and database
